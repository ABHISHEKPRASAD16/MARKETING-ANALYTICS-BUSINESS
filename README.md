# MARKETING-ANALYTICS-BUSINESS
In this project, I created an interactive Power BI dashboard for marketing analysis by leveraging SQL, Python, and Excel. I began by extracting and querying marketing data using SQL to ensure accuracy and consistency. Next, I used Python and Excel for data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory analysis to uncover patterns and insights. The dashboard was designed to visualize key marketing metrics such as customer segmentation, campaign performance, and ROI, providing actionable insights to stakeholders. This project showcased my ability to integrate technical skills with business insights, enabling data-driven decision-making and optimizing marketing strategies effectively.
